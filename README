This is a fairly crude mpd implementation in python that uses iTunes as a 
backend.  Lots of things don't work at this point I wrote it for my own fun. 
However control works from the clients I tested.

The basic architecture is a TCP/IP daemon is started and listens for clients.
Commands from the client are then mapped to applescript calls and used to
control iTunes.  A lot of functionalilty is currently missing due to lack of
equivalent iTunes functionality.
